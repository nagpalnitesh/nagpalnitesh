**Senior Software Engineer | Full-Stack | Remote-Ready**

Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building, shipping, and maintaining production-grade web applications.

Experienced in remote-first environments with strong ownership across the full software lifecycle — from system design and implementation to deployment and long-term maintenance.

## Professional Summary

- Senior-level full-stack engineer
- Strong backend and API design experience
- Production-focused mindset with real-world scaling considerations
- Comfortable working across US and EU time zones

## Independent & Open-Source Work (Conflict-Safe)

I maintain a small set of **independent, non-commercial, open-source projects** under **pixXmo**.

- Learning-driven and experimental
- No consulting, no client deliverables
- No proprietary data
- No overlap with employer IP or responsibilities

These projects exist to explore ideas, improve engineering depth, and contribute back to the developer community.

- Clear written communication and documentation
- Independent problem-solving with minimal hand-holding
- Strong ownership over features and systems
- Comfortable collaborating asynchronously across time zones
- Pragmatic decision-making with explicit trade-offs

---

## Open Source Focus

Public repositories typically include:

- Productivity utilities
- Automation and workflow experiments
- AI-assisted and web platform prototypes

Each repository is intentionally scoped and documented to reflect production-quality thinking.

---

## Beyond Engineering

I’m also interested in photography and visual storytelling.  
This background informs my approach to user experience, product polish, and clarity in interface design.
